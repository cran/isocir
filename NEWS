==================

Version 1.1-1, 27/09/2012

Some specific changes that make the package more user-friendly.

=================
Version 1.1, 16/04/2012

Removed the functions cirmean, cirkappa since analogous functions
are available in an existing package circular.

Rewrited all the remaining functions to improve their speed.
Renamed most of the functions for clarity as follows:

CIREi --> CIRE
CTi -->cond.test
cirSCE --> sce
plotcircularm --> plot.isocir

Changed the names of two arguments of former CIREi function:
- from isotropic to circular
- from levels to groups.

Changed the name of the argument of former CTi function
from levels to groups.

Added isocir/src/funCIRE.C in order to improve the speed of CIRE.

Created the S3 class isocir and the methods: isocir, is.isocir,
print.isocir and plot.isocir, related to this class.

Generated again the random data set with replications
that is called datareplic.

=================
Version 1.0, 27/04/2010
Released the version 1.0 in the CRAN.
