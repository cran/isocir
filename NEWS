version 1.9-2, 08/10/2013

General improvements in the code and in the help files.

=================

version 1.9-1, 08/10/2013

ACO function:

=================

Version 1.8, 16/09/2013

Function CIRE:
- relaxing condition 5 of PAVA circular to allow equalities in both sides.
- no argument new, just the new implementation with C.
- 0 and 2pi data are allowed in CIRE with circular restriction.

=================


Version 1.7, 13/08/2013

=================


Version 1.6, 14/08/2013

In the function FOCO the code has some changes as consequence of the implementation
of some improvements in the methodology (the distances when the argument time is used with TSP).

=================

Version 1.5, 23/04/2013

Missing values are now taken into account correctly in the next functions:
- cirsce
- FOCO
- CLM

Some little bugs corrected:
- cond.test function (when SCE=0)
- FOCO function (when TSP heuristics have one only solution)
- CLM function (when circular PAVA must or not be used).


=================

Version 1.4, 12/02/2013

A great change in the algorithm which calculates the CIRE in C code
in order to be even more computationally eficient and fast.

=================


Version 1.3, 23/01/2013

A new method of fusion of circular order has been implemented
and added to:
FOCO

CLM
Now, all the methodology is computationally eficient.
=================

Version 1.2, 23/01/2013

Some new functions have been incorporated:
FOCO
CLM
cirKendall
cirktau
cirsce
naiveSCE

These functions have the implementation of different methodologies
to fuse circular orders.

=================

Version 1.1-4, 22/01/2013

cond.test and mrl can now deal properly with missing data.
Some bugs are solved in CIRE function.

=================

Version 1.1-3, 13/12/2012

CIRE can deal with missing values in the data. There is also an improvement 
in its control of arguments.

=================

Version 1.1-2, 29/10/2012

An improvement in the C code that is part of the function CIRE

=================

Version 1.1-1, 27/09/2012

Some specific changes that make the package more user-friendly.

=================
Version 1.1, 16/04/2012

Removed the functions cirmean, cirkappa since analogous functions
are available in an existing package circular.

Rewrited all the remaining functions to improve their speed.
Renamed most of the functions for clarity as follows:

CIREi --> CIRE
CTi -->cond.test
cirSCE --> sce
plotcircularm --> plot.isocir

Changed the names of two arguments of former CIREi function:
- from isotropic to circular
- from levels to groups.

Changed the name of the argument of former CTi function
from levels to groups.

Added isocir/src/funCIRE.C in order to improve the speed of CIRE.

Created the S3 class isocir and the methods: isocir, is.isocir,
print.isocir and plot.isocir, related to this class.

Generated again the random data set with replications
that is called datareplic.

=================
Version 1.0, 27/04/2010
Released the version 1.0 in the CRAN.
